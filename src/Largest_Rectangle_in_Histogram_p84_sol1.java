Largest Rectangle in Histogram

(figures are in file p084)
Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1,
find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

For example,
Given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3],
return 10.

/**
 * Stack problem
 * 
 * We use a stack to hold non-descending bars. It means we can still extend rectangles from those bars. If incoming bar is low bar,
 * then we will start pop all taller bars from stack while updating result if necessary. To calculate the area of rectangle, we need
 * the height of popped bar and the index of the bar before the popped bar in the stack. To cover boundary cases, we will stop the loop
 * when i > height.length
 * 
 * Remark:
 * Time complexity: Each bar will be in the stack once, so the time complexity should be O(n)
 * Space complexity: O(n) in case all incoming bars are non-descending.
