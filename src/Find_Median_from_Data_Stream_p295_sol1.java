/**
 * Heap problem
 * 
 * we use two heaps to contain the first half and second half of input numbers. To be more specific, we will use a maxHeap to contain
 * the first half of input numbers and use a minHeap to contain the second half of input numbers so median number will always on top
 * of two heaps. For each incoming number, we will firstly insert it into minQ, then poll an element from minQ to maxQ, so the order
 * in two queues will be maintained. If we just do this, then all elements will remain in maxQ, so we will put elements back to minQ
 * if we found maxQ.size() > minQ.size(). This means elements in maxQ will always less than or equal to elements in minQ. If we need
 * to return median from odd len of inputs, we just need to return the top element in minQ
 * 
 * Time complexity: for addNum() each new element will cost O(logN) to balance queues, for findMedian(), each new element will cost O(1)
 * to get the median
 * Space complexity: O(N) as we will store all inputs into heap
