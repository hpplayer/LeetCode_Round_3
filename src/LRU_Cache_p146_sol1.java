LRU Cache

Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and set.

get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
set(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity,
 it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.
*/

/**
 * When using set(), we will have two cases. Case 1. we don't have such node yet. Therefore, we will create one, insert into list
 * then check if size has exceeded limits Case 2. We already have such node. So we need update its value, and update its poistion 
 * as well.
 * 
 * Sol1 is double-linkedList implementation
 * Sol2 is built-on linkedHashMap implementation
 * 
 * Remark: we can use the size of hashMap to track how many nodes we have in the cache, but I did not list it here
