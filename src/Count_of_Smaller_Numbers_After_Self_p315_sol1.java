/*
You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

Example:

Given nums = [5, 2, 6, 1]

To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.
Return the array [2, 1, 1, 0].

/**
 * Divide and Conquer solution
 * 
 * Here is the basic idea:
 * We just do merge sort on the input array. During the merge step, we merge the array backward. For each value from left part, we compare
 * it with corresponding value from right part, if it is larger than right part, then we add index(right) to the count(left), which means
 * there are index(right) number of values in right part is smaller than left value. So with merging backward, we can recursively update 
 * the count[] without extra effort. For values before current value in left part, we don't need to worry about them as their numbers have
 * already been counted before we put them there, i.e. we have scanned them in down layers before.
 * 
 * 
 * Remark:
 * 1) This problem is similar to problem Count_of_Range_Sum_p327_sol1
 * 2) The main idea is still a standard merge sort solution so the time complexity would be O(NLogN)
