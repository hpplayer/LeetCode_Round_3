290. Word Pattern

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

Examples:
pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.
pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.
Notes:
You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.

/**
 * HashMap solution
 * 
 * In this problem, we have one on one relationship in both direction, so two hashMaps are needed
 * In the map, we record the index that current char/string last appeared. If they are connected, then they should appear in same index
 * Otherwise we return false
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(N)
 * Space complexity: O(N)
 * 
 * Remark:
 * 1) Since we use Integer to record index, we need use equals() to compare two integers!
 * 2)Sol2 provides the solution that use char and string as map value, but it becomes more complicated than sol1
