254. Factor Combinations

Numbers can be regarded as product of its factors. For example,

8 = 2 x 2 x 2;
  = 2 x 4.
Write a function that takes an integer n and return all possible combinations of its factors.

Note: 
Each combination's factors must be sorted ascending, for example: The factors of 2 and 6 is [2, 6], not [6, 2].
You may assume that n is always positive.
Factors should be greater than 1 and less than n.
Examples: 
input: 1
output: 
[]
input: 37
output: 
[]
input: 12
output:
[
  [2, 6],
  [2, 2, 3],
  [3, 4]
]
input: 32
output:
[
  [2, 16],
  [2, 2, 8],
  [2, 2, 2, 4],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
  [2, 4, 4],
  [4, 8]
]

/**
 * Backtracking solution
 * 
 * We use backtracking to recursively decompose input n to smaller factors. 
 * Each recursion will try all possible factor combinations with smaller factor in front. If we found a pair, then we add two factors into temp list
 * then add to result list. Then we try to decompose the larger factor in next recursion
 * We don't want to build duplicate combinations like 2 2 4 vs 2 4 2, so we will set a start factor value for each recursion. Therefore our factors in 
 * list will always be in non-descending order and avoids duplicate
 * 
 * Time complexity: recursion, masters theorem, exponential
 * Space complexity: same as above
