320. Generalized Abbreviation

Write a function to generate the generalized abbreviations of a word.

Example:
Given word = "word", return the following list (order does not matter):
["word", "1ord", "w1rd", "wo1d", "wor1", "2rd", "w2d", "wo2", "1o1d", "1or1", "w1r1", "1o2", "2r1", "3d", "w3", "4"]
*/	

/**
 * 
 * The difficulty is that we need to consider compress the word multiple times. Ex: "word" -> "w1r1" or "word" -> "w2d"
 * The solution is to use a count variable to help us record how many chars we have abbreviated. In each position we have two choices 1) use char from
 * the input 2) use the count variable to abbreviate current char
 * 
 * Sol1 is recursive backtracking solution. Each layer will handle one char. For each char, we can either make it an abbreviation, update count, or 
 * we can make it as original char and insert it directly. For choice two, we need to finish previous count if count > 0
 * 
 * Time complexity: we have recursions, so master theory should be applied
 * Space complexity: same as above
 * 
 * Remark:
 * 
 * Sol2 is my first attempt solution. Instead of using count variable, I just check the last char in the result. If it is integer, then I can either 
 * add a char from input or abbreviate current char and accumulate the count variable. If it is char, then we will do the same thing
 * 
 * This problem is very similar to problem subsets, here we totally have 2^n possible abbreviation ways. That's because each char can either be abbreviated
 * or kept as it is therefore, there are totally 2^n ways to abbreviate the input.
