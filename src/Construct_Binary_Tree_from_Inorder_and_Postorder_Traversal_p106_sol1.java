106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal

Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

/**
 * Post-order and in-order traversal
 * 
 * We recursively shrink the ranges in inorder[] and postorder[].
 * We use postorder[] to find the vale of node, and we use inorder[] to find the whole tree.
 * Each recursion will handle a whole tree. The root of the tree will be the last cell in the curr range in postorder[]
 * Then we search this cell in inorder[] to find the index. Then we can easily get the size of left subtree and right subtree of this tree
 * Then we shrink the search range in two arrays, and recursively build next subtree
 * 
 * We can do this because there is no duplicates in the tree. This condition is also required otherwise if all nodes have same value, then we wouldn't
 * be able to get the structure
 * 
 * 
 * Time complexity: recursion, masters theorem, but the num of recursion is the num of subtrees we have, which would be O(N), and each recursion, we will
 * scan the inorder[] and find the target root index. In worst, the root may be in the rightmost index in inorder[], which means this tree only have left
 * subtrees. Therefore the time complexity is around O(N*N)
 * 
 * Space complexity: same as above, but may be O(N) at most
 * 
 * Sol1 is a recursive solution, and will always build look at a whole tree in the array, then break it down smaller subtrees, so it is top-down
 * Sol1 is more intuitive but slower
 * 
 * Sol2 is an iterative solution that will look at subtrees, then build a larger tree, so it is down-top
 * Sol2 is more complicated but faster
