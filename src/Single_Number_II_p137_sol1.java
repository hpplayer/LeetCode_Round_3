/*
137. Single Number II

Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

/**
 * Bit manipulation solution
 * 
 * This solution is very problem specific and very hard to write it correct
 * Overall we want to write a program such that update three variables based on input
 * Ones will be set to contain input when this input had appeared odd times
 * Twos will be set to contain input when this input has appeared two times
 * Threes will be set to contain input only when this input appears three times
 * 
 * When threes are set, then we make use threes to remove input from ones and twos. And input in threes will be removed
 * in next round since ones and twos have been reset
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(N)
 * Space complexity: O(1)
 * 
 * Sol1 is the bit manipulation solution with finite-machine idea
 * Sol2 is the bit manipulation solution with more intuitive approach but works slower (time: O(32N))
