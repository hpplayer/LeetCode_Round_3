/**
 * Sliding window + binary search
 * 
 * We create an array to record the accumulated sum of array
 * Then we use a loop to extend the right boundary of window. If we found current window has sum >= s, then we will use binary search to move the 
 * left boundary to the as right as possible. How? since inputs are all positive, the sum will be accumulated. So we just need to find the last index j
 * that has sums[j] < sums[right] - s, in other words, we want make sums[j] as large as possible when satisfying <= sums[right] - s; Then, the left boundary
 * of window will be the index next to j
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(NlogN), in case each cell in sums array satisfy the requirement, then we need do binary search for each index 
 * Space complexity: O(N)
