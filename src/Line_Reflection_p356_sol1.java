356. Line Reflection

Given n points on a 2D plane, find if there is such a line parallel to y-axis that reflect the given set of points.

Example 1:
Given points = [[1,1],[-1,1]], return true.

Example 2:
Given points = [[1,1],[-1,-1]], return false.

Follow up:
Could you do better than O(n2)?

Hint:

Find the smallest and largest x-value for all points.
If there is a line then it should be at y = (minX + maxX) / 2.
For each point, make sure that it has a reflected point in the opposite side.

/**
 * Sorting + observation solution
 * 
 * We observed that the reflection means we have points in two side of target line, and all points in one side
 * can have corresponding points in the other side.
 * 
 * So we firstly scan the input to find the target line, which is just (minX + maxX)/2. Since the target line
 * may not in an integer x, we define it as double
 * 
 * Then we sort the inputs, and use two points to find those corresponding points. In the sorting, we define 
 * that points before target line will have ascending trend in both x and y while points after target line
 * will have ascending in x and descending in y
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(nlogN) + O(N) => O(nlogN)
 * Space complexity: O(1)
 * 
 * Remark:
 * This problem is new, I haven't seen better solution. I will update it later if I found one
