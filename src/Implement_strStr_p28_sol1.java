Implement strStr()

Implement strStr().

Returns the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

/**
 * String + two pointer problem
 * 
 * we just use a nested loop to move two pointers on two input strings. If we found pointer reaches the end of string needle, then we found
 * a matching substring in haystack, just return i. If we found pointer reaches the tail of string haystack and we still have not reached the
 * end of needle, then we know there is no matching substring, just return -1. Otherwise we compare corresponding chars in two input strings.
 * 
 * Remark:
 * we will not put ending condition in the for loop unless we reach two cases mentioned above, so it is like a while(true) loop,
 * we couldn't write any statement after the for loop!!!!!!!!!!!!
 * Time complexity: O(mn)
 * Space complexity: O(1)
