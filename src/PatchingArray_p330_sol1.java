330. Patching Array

Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.

Example 1:
nums = [1, 3], n = 6
Return 1.

Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
So we only need 1 patch.

Example 2:
nums = [1, 5, 10], n = 20
Return 2.
The two patches can be [2, 4].

Example 3:
nums = [1, 2, 2], n = 5
Return 0.

/**
 * Greedy Solution
 * 
 * We scan the input array and use a temp variable to record currSum we can reach so far (exclusive).
 * To cover currSum, we need current val in array <= currSum.
 * So if this is the case, then we can cover all sums until currSum + nums[index] (exclusive)
 * If this is not the case, in other word, current val in array > currSum, then we need a patch to cover currSum.
 * To maximize the new cover range, we will pick currSum as the patch val. Then we compare new currSum with current val in array to see if we can
 * cover new currSum with current val in array
 * 
 * In worst case, we need scan the input array once, which is O(len(nums)), and we may still need logN patches,
 * so the total time complexity is O(len(nums) +LogN)
