/*
 * 
Read N Characters Given Read4 II - Call multiple times

The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.

By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.

Note:
The read function may be called multiple times.

/**
 * Array problem 
 * 
 * this problem is an advanced version of Read_N_Characters_Given_Read4_I_p157_sol1, and we don't need to know much about the algorithm
 * 
 * The difficulty in this problem is that we need to realize we may have chars left from last read, so before we use read4() to start
 * a new read, we need firstly read chars left from last read. So in this problem we need use a global array and two global variables to indicate
 * where and how much chars left from last read. In case last read is not full read, we need tempLength to tell us such information
 * 
 * Besides that, we always do the same thing with Read_N_Characters_Given_Read4_I_p157_sol1. But in the end of program, we also need to update tempStart
 * and tempLength accordingly. Updating tempLength is easy, we just check the difference between realRead and canWrite i.e. the number of chars we left
 * in temp[]. Updating tempStart is tricky, as we need to reset tempStart to 0 if we reach the end of temp[]. So it is better for us to use %4 operation
 * to get the tempStart, since if we reach the end of temp[], %4 will help us reset tempStart to be 0
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(n/4)* cost in read4() as we need read n chars in total
 * Space complexity: O(1) as we use an array of len 4 to be the temp buffer
