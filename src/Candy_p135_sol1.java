Candy

There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

/**
 * Scanning the array forward and backward solution
 * 
 * For each cell, it has requirement from previous cells and later cells. So we just use a count[] to record the requirement for
 * each cell. Then we scan the array forward and update the requirement from previous cells. After that, we scan the array backward,
 * and update the requirement from later cells. Finally we just sum number in each cell and it will be our solution
 * 
 * This algorithm runs in O(n) time 
 * and costs O(n) space
 * 
 * Sol1 is a solution using a temp table with two pass algorithm
 * Sol2 is a solution using two temp variable with one pass algorithm but is hard to come up with
