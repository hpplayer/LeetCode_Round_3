/*
5. Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. You may assume that the maximum length of S is 1000, and there exists one unique longest
palindromic substring.
*/

/**
 * Two pointer + observation solution
 * 
 * We will search the longest Palindrome substring from each possible core including single core and double cores
 * We will firstly pick the core, then extend the substring from two sides if the new string is still a valid palindrome
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(n^2)
 * Space complexity: O(1)
 * 
 * Sol2 lists a DP solution that also starts with cores, but use extra space. However It is a good practice for DP method
