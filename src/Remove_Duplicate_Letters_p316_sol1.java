316. Remove Duplicate Letters

Given a string which contains only lowercase letters, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appear once and only once.
You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

Example:
Given "bcabc"
Return "abc"

Given "cbacdcbc"
Return "acdb"
*/

/**
 * Stack solution
 * 
 * The key of this problem is that we need to make sure our result is the smallest in lexicographical order
 * So we need define a rule to keep that. For building a non-duplicate string, we can use a count table to achieve that.
 * For building the smallest string, we have to use a stack to keep the order. If new char is smaller than top char in stack, we will
 * keep pop chars from stack until new top char is <= new char or we don't have duplicate top char in remaining string
 * 
 * Time complexity: each char will be visited at most twice (insertion and removal from deque), so the time complexity should be O(n)
 * Space complexity: O(1), as our stack will be at most O(26) long
 * 
 * This solution is similar to Largest_Rectangle_in_Histogram_p84_sol1, where we also need to maintain a stack
 * with certain order
