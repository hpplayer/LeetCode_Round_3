Word Break

Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

For example, given
s = "leetcode",
dict = ["leet", "code"].

Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

/**
 * DP solution
 * 
 * We create a dp array to record the information whether we have a valid substring end at that index, for a longer substring, we just need
 * to find a shorter substring starts from 0 end at index j, and the dict contains the substring from j+1 to current index. So for the whole
 * string, we just need to check the dp value in the last cell.
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(n^2)
 * Space complexity: O(n)
