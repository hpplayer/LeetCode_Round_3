/*
368. Largest Divisible Subset

Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements
in this subset satisfies: Si % Sj = 0 or Sj % Si = 0.

If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.

Example 1:

nums: [1,2,3]

Result: [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)
Example 2:

nums: [1,2,4,8]

Result: [1,2,4,8]

/**
 * DP + observation solution
 * 
 * To add a new num into one of the existing subset, we don't need to check each num in existing subset,
 * that is too costly and not necessary, instead we just need to check the smallest and largest num in 
 * existing subset. The new incoming num should either divide smallest num without remainder or be divided 
 * by largest num without remainder. However if we can sort the the input, then we just need to check one end
 * either largest or smallest num. 
 * 
 * Here is the basic idea. We firstly sort the array,  then create a dp array. The value in dp[] means how 
 * long the subset would be with ending at this cell. The for each new input, we just need to check all prev
 * dp values to find the cell that can accept this new input while has largest len. Since we sort the input
 * from small to large, the only way the new input can be accepted is that it can divide the largest num in
 * this subset. Since we need to finally return the List<String>, we have to use a HashMap to record each subset
 * But that is ok, since the size of largest set is just 31. Why? The new incoming input is at least 2* the largest
 * num in prev array. We have 2^31 num in integer range. so the space complexity is still O(31N)
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(N^2)
 * Space complexity: O(N)
