/*
First Missing Positive

Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer.

For example,
Given [1,2,0] return 3,
and [3,4,-1,1] return 2.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant space.

/**
 * Array swap solution.
 * 
 * We need to swap cells in array so that 1 is in index 0, 2 is in index 1, and so on. For negative/extra positive number, we just keep it there, since
 * if they occupied the index of a later positive number, they will be swapped later. Otherwise their index will indicate that number is the first 
 * missing positive
 * 
 * Remark:
 * 1. To cover all cases, we better put 1 in index 0 instead of index 1. Otherwise, if array length is zero, we have to add extra boundary checks
 * Ex: [0] vs [1]!!!!!!!!!
 * 2. We may have duplicate numbers in the array and if they need to be placed in the correct position, then we would get into an infinite loop as
 * after first duplicate is put into the location, the second duplicate will always be in the incorrect position. So we have to do check to avoid
 * such case!!!!!!!!!!!!
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(n) since each for loop we should put an positive integer into the correct index. Even if we use i -- to recheck
 * the new value swapped to current cell, but that is not a redundant operation since we still put a positive integer into the correct 
 * index. So worst case n positive int in nums in incorrect positions, then we need to do swap O(n) time
 * 
 * Space complexity: O(1)
