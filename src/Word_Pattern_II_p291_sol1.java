291. Word Pattern II

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.

Examples:
pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue" should return true.
pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd" should return true.
pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc" should return false.
Notes:
You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.

/**
 * Backtracking solution
 * 
 * We use backtracking to try each possible matches with char in pattern and substring in str input. Each backtracking will check a char from pattern and match it
 * with a substring in str input
 * 
 * It is better to directly use char-string mapping here. Why? Since this time we don't know how to split the input string. Therefore we need
 * two indexes to find the next substring. One index points to the start of current substring, one index points to the end of current substring
 * So thing becomes complicated, which index should we keep in the HashMap? and how can we make this index be consistent with index in pattern?
 * Therefore, it is better to directly record the char and string in the Map
 * 
 * So we use a char and string map here. We also use a HashSet to record the relationship in reverse.
 * If char in pattern has been used before, then we will make use of hashMap to check match between char and substring
 * if char in pattern has not been used before, then we will try all possible substrings in str input to match it, we require this substring is not used before so
 * HashSet should not contain this substring
 * 
 * 
 * Time complexity: recursion, masters theorem, but must be exponential since each char in pattern can be matched to all substrings in str
 * Space complexity: same as above
 * 
 * Sol2 provides another implementation of DFS solution and using two HashMaps
