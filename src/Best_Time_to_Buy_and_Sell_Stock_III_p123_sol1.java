/*
Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III


Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

/**
 * DP solution
 * 
 * First of all we need to found when making two transactions will make more money than one transaction. The solution is
 * when we get a second low points. Example: 1 4 3 5. In this input, make one transaction will make profit of 4, but make 
 * two transactions will make profit of 5.
 * 
 * In this solution, we will use two variables firstBuy and SecondBuy to track the best buy time for two transactions. 
 * We also need two other variables firstBuyAndSell and secondBuyAndSell to track the best profit we can earn from these
 * two transactions
 * The value of SecondBuy variable should also include the profit we earn from firstBuyAndSell. If a single transaction 
 * can already make the max global profit, then the value of firstBuy and SecondBuy and the value of firstBuyAndSell and
 * secondBuyAndSell should be same. In other words, the profit from secondBuyAndSell should always larger or equal the profit
 * from firstBuyAndSell
 * 
 * So the basic idea is to scan the array and update 4 variables accordingly, then return secondBuyAndSell
 * Remember that we need to reverse the value of buy, so we have same trend for buy and buy-sell i.e. we want them all be max 
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(n)
 * Space complexity: O(1)
