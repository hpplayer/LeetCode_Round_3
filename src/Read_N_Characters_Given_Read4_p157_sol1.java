/*

Read N Characters Given Read4

The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.

By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.

Note:
The read function will only be called once for each test case.

/**
 * Array problem 
 * 
 * this problem is a very practical problem, and we don't need to know much about the algorithm
 * 
 * There will be two ending cases for read 1) we have read n chars 2) we reach the end of file.
 * So we will check this two condition before we read next chars from read4().
 * In those boundary cases, we may not read 4 chars due to end of file or we read 4 chars but are now allowed to write 4 chars due
 * to n chars limits. So our output on buf[] should be depend on the real chars we read
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(n/4)* cost in read4() as we need read n chars in total
 * Space complexity: O(1) as we use an array of len 4 to be the temp buffer
