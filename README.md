# LeetCode_Round_3

LeetCode Round3!

In this round, I will focus on cleanness and completeness of solution, and may reduce the explanation for each problem

Update (06/10/2016 12:02AM):

I finally finished round3.
Totally 83 working days cost.
But the actual time perios is longer 83 working days. 

I started this round since the late of my last semester as a graduate student.
I finished this round after I have been working for 2 monthes. 
I moved from Texas to Washington now. 
The time period is like following:
first period: school (from Nov-Dec, 2015), I tried to finish round3 as soon as possible
second period: bay area (from Jan-Mar, 2016), I tried to cover all new problems as well as old problems
third period: seattle(from Apr-June, 2016), I tried my best to work in the night to finish the rest problems 

I learnt a lot from this round3 programming. And I really enjoyed it!

Thanks, leetcode
Thanks, myself!
